# Weather Dashboard

## Goal

Build a weather dashboard by retrieving data from the OpenWeather One Call API.  
You can look up the weather for multiple cities, which the user will be presented with the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast.  
Also, any searched city will be added to the local storage for previous cities searched. 
The user will be presented with the current conditions with city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the current UV index.
Also, the user will be presented with the 5 day forecast, which will consist of the date, icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
